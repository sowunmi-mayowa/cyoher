        <h2>leisure and tourism</h2>
        <p>Brief History The Leisure and Tourism Department of The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro took off with 43 students in October, 2016. The pioneering students graduated in October 2018 with 5 distinction students. In line with vision, which is aligned to the corporate strategy of FPI (to be the best in Nigeria within its mandate) we have adopted emphasis on practical training. As a polytechnic, we emphasize ‘Leisure and Tourism’; hence for all our courses, practical contents are compulsory (in addition to those specified by the National Board for Technical Education, NBTE). Our goal is to ensure that our graduates are job-ready (either as employees or self-employed). To make this possible, the management ensures that all necessary equipment is available. We have electricity 24 hours and our equipment is state-of-the-art. Our music studios is perhaps the best owned by any tertiary institution in Nigeria.</p>
