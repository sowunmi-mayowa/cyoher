        <h2>Science laboratory technology</h2>
    <p>
        Science Laboratory technology Department is one of the foundation academic department of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro.  It was established in November, 1979.

        The department started off with a student population of eighteen (18), all in the first year of the then Nigerian National Diploma programmes under the able leadership of Dr. K. O. Jibodu as the pioneer Head of Department.  The department had an academic staff strength of nine (9) and five (5) supporting staff during its first two years of existing.

        The first set of students in the programme proceeded to the Higher National Diploma without breaking the Polytechnic education into two tiers.  Our first set of National Diploma students graduated at the end of the 1981/1982 academic session while the Higher National Diploma students graduated at the end of the 1982/1983 academic session.

        Presently, the Department staff strength has grown to forty four (44) Academic staff and ten (10) supporting staff with a substantive academic growth in our programs at Higher National Diploma Level with options in chemistry, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Environmental  Biology and Physics with electronics.

        Over the years, with support of the institution the department have embarked on a rigorous staff development aimed at sharpening the research and teaching skills of staff by sponsoring them to attend conferences (both local and international), seminars, workshops, short and long term courses leading to award of higher degrees.
