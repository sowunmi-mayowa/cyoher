The academic staff of the department worked so hard and by October 2010, an interim accreditation for HND Computer Science was also granted with a class of one stream of 30 students. By November, an additional stream was granted by the NBTE for HND programme making a total of 2 streams of 30 students (60 students). In 2016, full accreditation of HND programme and reaccreditation of ND programme was carried out by the same body – NBTE.
