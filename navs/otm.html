    <p>
        Welcome to the Department of Office Technology and Management of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State Nigeria. The Department which was formerly known as Secretarial Studies Department was established at the inception of the Institution in 1979. At the inception, the Department had one permanent Lecturer and two visiting teachers for the Departmental courses while the remaining courses were handled by Lecturers from other Departments. Also, a total number of twenty six (26) students were admitted for National Diploma Programme. The quality of staff of the Department coupled with the teaching facilities and equipment, led to the accreditation of its ND and HND Programmes in 1984. The Department was also re-accredited by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) for both ND and HND Programmes in 2006 and 2013 respectively. The Department has since been growing in Staff and Students Strengths. Presently, the Department has Three Hundred and Sixteen (316) Full-Time and Ninety Four (94) Part-Time Students. It also has twelve (12) Full-Time Academic Staff and One (1) Part-Time Teaching Staff. Apart from the teaching staff, the Department has four (4) Non-academic and One (1) I.T. Staff. It is pertinent to state that the Department has produced eminent personalities who are performing excellently well in their various organisations both within and outside Nigeria. By the special grace of God and with the support so far received from the Management of the Institution under the leadership of Arc. O. O. Aluko Ph.D, the Department hopes to start Bilingual Programme very soon. This would enable our graduates to be gainfully employed both within and outside the country.
