        <h2>Hospitality Management</h2>
    <p>
        Hospitality Management is one of the viable disciplines in the School of Pure and Applied Sciences, The Federal Polytechnic Ilaro. The responsibility of the department is to train manpower for operational and managerial levels in the hospitality sub-sector of the economy. At present, the Department of Hospitality Management has a well trained workforce to deliver on the mandate of personnel training for the hospitality industry through the National and Higher National Diploma programmes ran in the department. Additionally, the personnel are qualified members and fellows of relevant professional associations, including Hospitality and Tourism Management Association of Nigeria (HATMAN), which provides leverage for proper curriculum delivery. Facilities include the main kitchen and restaurant, demonstration kitchen and restaurant, and the demonstration hotel, which provide opportunity for successful practical content delivery to meet up with contemporary operational and managerial skills for industry development.

        The Department of Hospitality Management (formerly Hotel and Catering Management) started in the 1994/1995 Academic Session with a certificate programme in Hotel and Catering Management. In the 2000/2001 Academic Session, the department commenced the National Diploma (ND) programme in Hotel and Catering Management while the approval to run the Higher National Diploma (HND) was granted by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) in the year 2010. However, the nomenclature of the department was changed to Hospitality Management in the year 2016
