        <p>The Department of Food Technology is one of the first generation departments of the Polytechnic which came on board with the inception of the Polytechnic in 1979. The Department was established during the 1981/82 academic session with only the ND programme and the HND was added in 1984/85 session but due to lack of accreditation was discontinued in 1987. However, the accreditation status was reinstated during the 2003/04 session. Then we had just the Departments of Food Technology and Science Laboratory Technology making up the School of Applied Science now known as the School of Pure and Pure and Applied Sciences. The school has about six departments today</p>
