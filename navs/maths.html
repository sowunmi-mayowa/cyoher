    <p>
        You are welcome to the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, School of Pure and Applied Sciences, a department that has produced a team of statisticians for both private and public sectors of the national economy and the world at large. The achievement of this feat is in line with the vision and mission statements of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, which are “To be a market leader in the provision of Technically Skilled Manpower for Nigeria and Globally Competitive Economy” and “To provide Opportunities of Qualitative Technical Education in a Serene and Conductive Learning Environment to all Eligible Nigerians and others who will drive the National and the Global Industrial Economy” respectively. The department was established in 2004 under the supervision of the Head of department. The NBTE resource inspection team visited the department in the same year 2004 and upon the successful resource inspection, approval was granted by NBTE to run the ND programme in Statistics. The department admitted the first set of ND Statistics students in 2004/2005 academic session. The proposal to run the HND programme in Statistics was presented to NBTE Resource Inspection Team in 2007 and was granted that same year. The first set of students was admitted in to the HND programme in Statistics in 2008/2009. The department has since then been running both ND and HND programme in Statistics. The department is divided into Mathematics and Statistics units headed by the respective Heads of units. Each Head of unit is responsible for the running of his unit and reporting to the Head of the department.
